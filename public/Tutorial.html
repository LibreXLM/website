  <h1>How to Create Your First Personal Token</h1>
  <div class="content">

    <p>
      This guide will walk you through the basic steps of creating your first personal token 
      on the Stellar network. No prior blockchain experience required – just curiosity 
      and a wallet with a little XLM for fees.
    </p>

    <!-- THINGS TO CONSIDER FIRST -->
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Things to Consider: What Kind of Token Are You Creating?</h2>
      <p>
        Before you touch any settings or issue a single unit, it helps to be clear about 
        what your token is supposed to be. In practice, many ideas fall into two simple categories:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Community Token for a Personal Brand</h3>
      <p>
        A community token is mostly about people, not markets. It can act like a 
        programmable membership card:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to content, perks or private groups.</li>
        <li>Recognition or reputation inside a community.</li>
        <li>Voting power or other social utility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this case, the main value comes from what your community does with the token, 
        not from complex trading logic.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Personal Store of Value / Experimental Trading Token</h3>
      <p>
        The idea behind <b>LIBRE</b> and its trading tokens is closer to a personal, 
        programmable store of value. You can think of it like setting up your own transparent, 
        on-chain mini “basket” of assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple example: you add liquidity with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>50% in XLM</li>
        <li>50% in USDC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If there are no extra trading fees or special logic, the value behind your token 
        is effectively determined by how XLM and USDC perform over time. Your token becomes 
        a live representation of that 50/50 basket.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can extend this idea by including more assets in your liquidity, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>BTC, ETH</li>
        <li>USDC, EURC or other stablecoins</li>
        <li>SHX or other Stellar-based assets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each new asset changes the risk/return profile and behavior of your token.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>LIBRE</b> and its trading tokens follow this second idea: they are designed as 
        experimental stores of value where a network of interconnected tokens trades 
        against each other. With continuous trading and fees, the system explores how 
        motion, volatility and on-ledger fee flows can contribute to value creation 
        over time. It is an ongoing experiment, not investment advice.
      </p>

    <!-- NOW THE STEPS -->

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 1: Set up a Stellar Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        You need a Stellar wallet that allows issuing tokens. Popular choices include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://lobstr.co/" target="_blank">LOBSTR</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://freighter.app/" target="_blank">Freighter</a> (browser extension)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fund your wallet with at least a few lumens (XLM). These are required as a base 
        reserve and for transaction fees.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 2: Create an Issuer Account</h2>
      <p>
        Tokens on Stellar are always issued from a special account. You can use your wallet 
        to generate a new keypair. This account will hold the authority to issue your token.
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        Example Keypair:<br>
        Public Key: GXXXX...<br>
        Secret Key: SXXXX...
      </div>
      <p>
        ⚠️ Important: Keep the secret key safe. Whoever controls it, controls your token.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 3: Define Your Token</h2>
      <p>
        Choose a code (up to 12 characters) and a name. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Code:</b> YOURNAME</li>
        <li><b>Name:</b> Your Personal Token</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can then issue your token by sending a "payment" from the issuer account 
        to your main account with the chosen code.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 4: Write a TOML File</h2>
      <p>
        A TOML file makes your token discoverable and trustworthy. Create a file 
        <code>stellar.toml</code> in your GitHub Pages repository and describe your token:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
[[CURRENCIES]]<br>
code="YOURNAME"<br>
issuer="GYOURISSUERACCOUNT"<br>
display_decimals=7<br>
name="Your Personal Token"<br>
desc="This is my personal token, created to explore the LibreTradingEcosystem."<br>
image="https://your-link-to-token-logo.png"<br>
      </div>
      <p>
        Make sure the TOML file is hosted at:<br>
        <code>yourwebsite.well-known/stellar.toml</code>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 5: Add Liquidity (Optional)</h2>
      <p>
        To make your token tradable, add it to an AMM liquidity pool against XLM, USDC, 
        or even another experimental token in the LibreTradingEcosystem.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 6: Share Your Token</h2>
      <p>
        Congratulations 🎉 You’ve just created your first personal token! 
        Share your asset code and issuer address so others can find and trust it.
