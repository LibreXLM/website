  <h1>How to Create Your First Personal Token</h1>
  <div class="content">

    <p>
      This guide will walk you through the basic steps of creating your first personal token 
      on the Stellar network. No prior blockchain experience required – just curiosity 
      and a wallet with a little XLM for fees.
    </p>

    <!-- THINGS TO CONSIDER FIRST -->
    <div class="step">
      <h2>Things to Consider: What Kind of Token Are You Creating?</h2>
      <p>
        Before you touch any settings or issue a single unit, it helps to be clear about 
        what your token is supposed to be. In practice, many ideas fall into two simple categories:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Community Token for a Personal Brand</h3>
      <p>
        A community token is mostly about people, not markets. It can act like a 
        programmable membership card:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to content, perks or private groups.</li>
        <li>Recognition or reputation inside a community.</li>
        <li>Voting power or other social utility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In this case, the main value comes from what your community does with the token, 
        not from complex trading logic.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Personal Store of Value / Experimental Trading Token</h3>
      <p>
        The idea behind <b>LIBRE</b> and its trading tokens is closer to a personal, 
        programmable store of value. You can think of it like setting up your own transparent, 
        on-chain mini “basket” of assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple example: you add liquidity with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>50% in XLM</li>
        <li>50% in USDC</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If there are no extra trading fees or special logic, the value behind your token 
        is effectively determined by how XLM and USDC perform over time. Your token becomes 
        a live representation of that 50/50 basket.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can extend this idea by including more assets in your liquidity, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>BTC, ETH</li>
        <li>USDC, EURC or other stablecoins</li>
        <li>SHX or other Stellar-based assets</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each new asset changes the risk/return profile and behavior of your token.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>LIBRE</b> and its trading tokens follow this second idea: they are designed as 
        experimental stores of value where a network of interconnected tokens trades 
        against each other. With continuous trading and fees, the system explores how 
        motion, volatility and on-ledger fee flows can contribute to value creation 
        over time. It is an ongoing experiment, not investment advice.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- NOW THE STEPS -->

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 1: Set up a Stellar Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        You need a Stellar wallet that allows you to hold multiple assets and sign transactions. 
        Popular choices include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://lobstr.co/" target="_blank">LOBSTR</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://freighter.app/" target="_blank">Freighter</a> (browser extension)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Create or restore your wallet and fund it with at least a few lumens (XLM). 
        XLM is required as a base reserve and to pay for transaction fees on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        This main wallet will usually act as your “personal” wallet – the place where you hold 
        and manage your assets, including the tokens you create.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 2: Create an Issuer Account and a Distribution Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        On Stellar, tokens are issued from a dedicated <b>issuer account</b>, but they are usually 
        held and traded from a separate <b>distribution account</b>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Issuer account:</b> Has the authority to issue (mint) your token.</li>
        <li><b>Distribution account:</b> Holds the actual balance of your token and sends it to users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using your wallet or the Stellar Laboratory, generate a new keypair for the issuer account and 
        fund it with the minimum XLM required to exist on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then decide which account will be your <b>distribution wallet</b>. This can be your main wallet 
        or another dedicated account. On the distribution account, you must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a <b>trustline</b> to your new asset (your token code + issuer public key).</li>
        <li>Make sure the asset’s code/name is clear so you can recognize it in the wallet interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Without this trustline on the distribution account, it cannot receive or hold your newly created token.
      </p>
      <p>
        ⚠️ Important: Keep the issuer secret key safe. Whoever controls it, controls the ability 
        to mint more of your token (unless you later lock the issuer).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 3: Issue Your Token Using Stellar Laboratory</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>an issuer account, and</li>
        <li>a distribution account with a trustline to your new asset,</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        …you can actually <b>create (issue) your token</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do this using the official Stellar Laboratory at 
        <a href="https://lab.stellar.org" target="_blank">https://lab.stellar.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Laboratory, go to the transaction builder and:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the <b>“Send Payment”</b> operation.</li>
        <li>Set the <b>source account</b> to your issuer account.</li>
        <li>Set the <b>destination account</b> to your distribution wallet.</li>
        <li>As the <b>asset</b>, choose “Alphanumeric” and enter your token code (e.g. <code>YOURNAME</code>) and your issuer public key.</li>
        <li>Enter the <b>amount</b> you want to issue (for example, <code>1000</code>).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you submit and sign this transaction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The issuer account “pays” the distribution account with your new asset.</li>
        <li>This first payment is effectively the moment your token comes into existence on the Stellar network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After sending the payment, you have officially created your first token and it now exists as a 
        balance on your distribution account.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 4: Write a TOML File</h2>
      <p>
        A TOML file makes your token discoverable and trustworthy. Create a file 
        <code>stellar.toml</code> in your GitHub Pages repository (or any HTTPS-hosted site) 
        and describe your token:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
[[CURRENCIES]]<br>
code="YOURNAME"<br>
issuer="GYOURISSUERACCOUNT"<br>
display_decimals=7<br>
name="Your Personal Token"<br>
desc="This is my personal token, created to explore the LibreTradingEcosystem."<br>
image="https://your-link-to-token-logo.png"<br>
      </div>
      <p>
        Make sure the TOML file is hosted at:<br>
        <code>https://yourgithubusername.github.io/.well-known/stellar.toml</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this is online and correctly formatted, wallets like LOBSTR and explorers like 
        Stellar.Expert can show your token logo and description.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 5: Add Liquidity (Optional)</h2>
      <p>
        To make your token tradable, you can add it to an AMM liquidity pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Stellar-based interfaces that support AMMs, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a pool between your token and XLM,</li>
        <li>or between your token and USDC,</li>
        <li>or even pair it with another experimental token from the LibreTradingEcosystem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By depositing both assets into the pool, you make it possible for others to swap your token. 
        If fees are enabled, the pool can also start accumulating trading fees over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <h2>Step 6: Share Your Token</h2>
      <p>
        Congratulations 🎉 You’ve just created your first personal token!
      </p>
      <p>
        Share your asset code and issuer address so others can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>add a trustline to your asset,</li>
        <li>view it on Stellar.Expert or other explorers,</li>
        <li>and, if you added liquidity, trade it on AMM pools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Be clear whether this is a community token, an experimental store of value, 
        or part of a broader system like the LibreTradingEcosystem. 
        You are now running your own micro-asset on a live network.
